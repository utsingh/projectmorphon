Project Morphon
===============

Project Morphon is an attempt at a universally compatible IoT unifying framework that uses the abstraction of a human body to deliver scalable, interconnected IoT systems. The framework could also be used in a robotic environment to keep tabs on all IoT devices in an "all systems ok" fashion.

Language: Javascript w/ Angular 2.0


Morphon is Latin for an organism. The human body serves as an exemplary example of a functioning machine that has interdependent components and excellent error handling (external and internal).
We wish to use the human body as a model for an abstraction layer when dealing with the IoT devices.

Imagine a modular framework based on the human body, where every system is modular in itself and recursively follows the human body abstraction. What this means is that if you made a device with a small brain, a.k.a. a small microchip, and now want to scale it using a full fledged neural network, you can just simply switch out the brain component and bind the ‘organism’ to the new brain.

You can use this abstraction in an endless array of applications. Consider, the problem of home-automation. With so many companies investing so many devices, there is no center point to manage your home.

With the morphon framework which uses the human body abstraction, you can integrate systems like they are in a human body. If you assume the home to be a humanoid form, then the electrical connections acts like the nervous system of the ‘organism’, the plumbing system like the circulatory-cum-excretory system, and the air-conditioning system similar to the way the state of homeostasis is maintained your body.

Morphon is a fully extendable suite of framework that can integrate all your IoT devices in one interface that tells you that all systems are normal. If anything goes wrong, you see the particular error. To troubleshoot, you can even bypass the particular component (say, the heart or the water pump). Within the pump itself, you can use the similarities it has with it’s function similar to that of the heart. It has valves, intake and outgoing pipes, power like a pacemaker, etc.

To create the interface for a new device, just think of it’s place within the context of a human being, and voila. You can just add the component to the framework and scale as needed. It functions similar to the Ionic Framework which is also written in Javascript and Angular.

We assume protobuf to be the universally changeable data format which is why we let people pick their favorite language to make their IoT device, then communicate using JSON/protobuf with our framework.

Home automation is one of the biggest problems this framework addresses but there can be endless more applications, like maybe a vehicle, or any other device with a bunch of sensors in it that generate data and there is a need to organize that data in a human consumable manner.
